    "Consider the following **simple** algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Maintain a set of R of representatives of the stream that are at least 2tau apart from one another\n",
    "    If stream contains an item >= 2tau from R, then add it to R\n",
    "If at some stage R has size at least k+1, then FAIL\n",
    "Otherwise, output R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Either $R$ is a solution of cost $2\\tau$, because it never had more than $k$ items, that is, all other items in the stream are at most $2\\tau$ from something in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if it returns FAIL, the **Lemma** states that there is no solution of cost less than $\\tau$(optimal cost is at least $\\tau$)\n",

    "## Parallel Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We produce an $\\alpha+O(\\epsilon)$ factor approximation of optimal\n",

    "**Initialize** by determining a lower bound $c$ on optimal cost. **Let** $p=\\lceil\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\epsilon})\\rceil$. We will at all times maintain $p$ instances of the **simple** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the thresholds for the instances are: $c(1+\\epsilon), c(1+\\epsilon)^2, \\cdots, c(1+\\epsilon)^p$\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever an instance return FAIL:\n",
    "* Raise its threshold by a factor of $(1+\\epsilon)^p$\n",
    "* Although this instance cannot access directly the items it has already seen, it relies on the representatives $R$ of the stream so far to represent the part of the stream already read\n",
    "\n",
    "If $c(1+\\epsilon)$ fails, we then maintain $p$ instances from $c(1+\\epsilon)^2$ to $c(1+\\epsilon)^{p+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the thresholds keep increasing, some instance has to (eventually) succeed.\n",

    "## Space requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, $O(k)$ space to determine a lower bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $p$ copies of a $O(k)$ space **simple** algorithm\n",

    "Hence, with $\\alpha$ begin constant, the total space needed is\n",
    "$O(k\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\epsilon}))=O(\\frac{k\\log{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}}{\\log{1+\\epsilon}})=O((\\frac{k}{\\epsilon})\\log{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}})$\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $t$ be this threshold\n",
    "* But the threshold of this **instance** might have increased several times as the stream flowed\n",
    "* Let's say it increased $j$ times\n",
    "* So we had the following threshold $t_1, t_2, \\cdots, t_{j+1}=t$\n",
    "* Break up the stream $\\sigma$ into $j+1$ phases, each corresponding to a different threshold: $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\cdots, \\sigma_{j+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, threshold $t_i=t_{j+1}/((1+\\epsilon)^p)^{j+1-i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we choose $p=\\lceil\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\epsilon})\\rceil$ so that $(1+\\epsilon)^p\\ge\\alpha/\\epsilon$\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, $\\Delta(R_{i-1}\\cdot\\sigma_i, R_i)$\n",

    "\n",
    "We claim that cost between $\\sigma_1\\cdot\\sigma_2\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot\\sigma_i$ and $R_i$ is at most the cost between $R_{i-1}\\cdot\\sigma_i$ and $R_i$ plus the cost between $\\sigma_1\\cdot\\sigma_2\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot\\sigma_{i-1}$ and $R_{i-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Delta(\\sigma_1\\cdot\\sigma_2\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot\\sigma_i, R_i)$ is sustained by $\\Delta(\\sigma_i, R_i)$, then the above claim holds.\n",

    "* Then the triangle inequality tells us that this cost is at most $\\Delta(\\sigma_1\\cdot\\sigma_2\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot\\sigma_{i-1}, R_{i-1})$ plus the cost from $R_{i-1}$ to $R_i$\n",
